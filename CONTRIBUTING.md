# contributors


Feel free to contribute.

Although it won't be enforced, it's preferable for any newly-introduced code to be parsed with [**prettier**](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (with pretty much all the default options)

Would especially love pointless contributions to micro-optimizations (yes, I am one of those *"gotta make it go faster hngggg.."* devs).

Yah that's all really.
